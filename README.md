# The Randomizer Repo

An open-source collection of algorithms for randomizing progression in games, from item placement to recipe shuffling to room transitions. These algorithms guarantee completability, while providing a fresh experience each time via structurally changing the game's dependency structure.

## Overview

In the course of working on a [randomizer mod](https://github.com/exfret/propertyrandomizer) for the factory-building game Factorio, I found my randomization techniques differed significantly from those of other randomization communities. I am hoping this repository can be a central location for hosting game-agnostic versions of these randomization algorithms. I believe the approach to game randomization I use could be useful to others designing randomization mods, as well as designers of games like rogue-likes that heavily employ procedural generation of game content.
